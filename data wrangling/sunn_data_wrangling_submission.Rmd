# Process

Blink-182 was one of my favorite bands growing up and certainly falls into the category of bands that have changed their sound over the years.
Their new style is noticeably more pop and less juvenile than their earlier work, but some elements, such as the use of repetitive melodic recitatives (example: “na na na na na na”) remain the same.

I thought it might be interesting to gather a corpus of Blink-182 lyrics to analyze.
While there are APIs that have lyrical content for certain artists available, I decided to use web scraping instead since many fan sourced sites have transcriptions of live songs that are not found on commercial APIs.
The site I used is azlyrics.com since it contains not only the song lyrics but album information and year of release.
I used Python for this assignment, specifically the `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` libraries.

The first step to getting a corpus of lyrics is getting a list of all the songs available for that artist on azlyrics.
This can be done by getting the html for Blink-182 artists page and then using a basic CSS selector to grab both the names of all the songs and the corresponding href attribute for the URL to the individual lyrics page and storing this information as dictionaries.
Overall there are 176 songs on azlyrics.com for Blink-182, so 176 dictionaries will be created and stored together in a list.

Afterwards, I converted this list of dictionaries into a pandas dataframe to iterate through the list of song URLs.
These URLs led to individual song pages that contained both the lyrics and other information such as the album and year of release.
The lyrics were contained in a div that did not have any identifying attributes, so the only way to get to this text in the DOM is to use a CSS selector.
Thankfully, the individual song pages all have about the same format with only some variation.
The text did need to be cleaned slightly since it contained newline and carriage return whitespace characters.

Scraping the other information off the page was slightly more complicated since the div which contains the album name and release date needs to be cleaned using regular expressions.
However, some trial and error eventually yielded the correct expression to extract both the album name and the year.
There are likely some edge cases that are being missed with this particular regex, such as Unicode characters, but for the Blink-182 discography this approach seems to work.

Some other considerations that I had were using an inner join to connect the dataframe containing the song information with the original dataframe containing all the song titles and URLs.
Finally, I had to make sure to put a sleep in between scrapes of the individual song pages, since otherwise azlyrics.com would think I am malicious traffic and block me from their server.
This took a few tries to get right, since it was difficult for me to estimate how quick I could make the sleeps without being blocked.
I did implement a print statement to stdout so I could tell if and where the script stopped working.
The final corpus of lyrics was exported using pandas as both a csv and json file.

Some fun ideas I have for this dataset include analyzing the sentiment of Blink-182 songs over time, charting the length of songs between different albums, or possibly training a Markov Chain to write my own Blink-182 songs!

# Initial Data

The initial data of this project were HTML webpages.

From the scale provided on this assignment, I estimate that the data is suitable for this assignment.
Using the assignment point system as a checklist, here is how the web scraped lyrics corpus matches up:

+ Was mostly in a standardized form, but some songs' pages were structured differently (for example, to accomodate featured artists) so the script had to be adjusted accordingly for those songs
+ Data was split across multiple webpages, and hence, multple HTML files
+ Data is in a format other than CSV, JSON, or in a database
+ Data does contain punctuations, but for the purposes of this assignment I opted not to remove them
+ Dataset is relatively small at only 212KB total
+ The way I scraped the data involved a two dataframes, one listing the songs, and one with the song information and between the two of them there are a few types of related data (ex: year vs album name)
+ Data was accessed using `requests` library, not downloading a file or connecting to a database

Some of the points will be subjective, but I estimate the difficulty of this dataset to be at least a 4.

Below is an excerpt of an example song lyrics webpage from azlyrics.com, with only the relevant sections which I scrape data from.
These individual sections are separated with an ellipsis.

# Example Data: CSV

Below are the first few rows of the resulting csv.
Note that a column of this data is song lyrics, held as a string, which takes a large amount of space and cannot be
accurately displayed on the document.

Additionally, I can provide the actual csv files as proof of the extraction working correctly.

# Example Data: JSON

This data is output using the `to_json` method in pandas DataFrames.
By default, it outputs the data as `orient='index'`, but can instead be output in other formats.
In the example below, I output it with `orient='records'`.

```

# Example of the Loaded Data

Below is the head of the csv after it is loaded into RStudio using `readr`.

kable(head(blink_songs, n = 2))
